			I'm Tori, a web developer with a background in Customer Success.

			My passion for front-end development started in middle school when I built and sold custom profiles for online games. My interest expanded as I put my skills to use making Live Journal layouts and customizing my MySpace page. In hindsight, that is a very early 2000 sentence. Though, my path back to web development is unconventional, and has taken me all over the world working in fields ranging from education to policy, I am happy to be doing what I truly love. When I'm not pushing to github, I like to write, cross stitch, hike, and horeseback ride.
